                Hello! My name is Akil. CEO of Apex IT farm. I'm a full stack web developer and a graphic designer. I'm
                from Bangladesh. The starting of my programming journey has a quite funny story actually. After watching some coding 
                related movies I wanted to become a hacker. Then I started my programming journey with C and C++. I was 
                only 15 years old then. After quite some time I realized that hacking profession is not actually my type. But I fell in love 
                with programming. It was 2017 when I decided to become a web developer. In order to become a good and 
                professional web developer I had to learn graphic designing. I was enjoying graphic designing too. After 
                completing my graphic designing course I started to learn web developing again. It was early of 2018 when 
                I sucessfully built my first website. I'm also professional at graphic designing. I can make logo, business 
                card, id card, flyer, poster, banner etc. So far I have create many websites and graphic designing projects. 
                In the <p id="last">footer section I have added the link of my github and behance account. Feel free to check it out.</p>
